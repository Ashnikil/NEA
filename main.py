#a mining game where u can mine ores and sell them to make money to buy upgrades ,
# there will be an online database where u can create a username and password (with input
# sanitisation and a minimum/maximum length for the username and password) also it will be randomly
# generated and i might add more stuff later on for example achievements
# -> users will be able to sign up and log in
# -> users can save their data to ensure its not lost
# -> users will be able to move with arrow keys
# -> users can dig down and will find ores that are randomly placed
# -> there will be an achievements page which tracks if the user has done/is doing a certain achievement and the user will be able to see what progress they have made in the achievements
# -> there will be a shop where they can buy things and will tell them if they have enough money or not , and when they buy something their money will go down accordingly
# -> there will be a wide variety of ores worth different amounts of money
# -> there will be walls that can not be broken down (eg: on the sides of the map)
# -> there will be different layers of rock (down) that can only be broken with the correct pickaxe which can be bought in the shop
# -> there will be a functioning options page with achievements and settings where the user can change certain things , eg: volume / controls

#
# my game will be a 2d mining game where u can move left and right (until the end of the screen , where there will be a wall of sorts) and down , and u have to dig down to find ores which u can sell (maybe later ill adding a crafting mechanism) for money to buy better equipment.
#
# in my game i want to add a sign up and login page where they will be able to choose a username and password which will be saved online/locally so they can continue where they left off and will save certain parts of data
#
# also i want to create a bot in my game which can be acquired later on which , using ai , can collect certain ores for the user
#the ai will look at what ores the players collect and decide what the players needs more and collects those automatically
